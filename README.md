# ROSCODE
Repository of all packages and code for ROS

Description:
This package is intended for use with the University of St. Thomas Senior Design Autonomous Snowplow project.  It contains packages for use with a Sabertooth 2x32 motor controller and interfaces an RPLIDAR 360 for navigation using SLAM.


Packages:

plow_motor_control: used for sending commands to a Sabertooth motor controller thorugh serial (via an Arduino)
driveway_sim: used for simulating simple plowing strategies (very rough and currently only being used for demonstration purposes)
